These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine to try stuff around. See deploy for notes on how to make the final html file.

[Check it out](https://musicplayer.brunoperry.net/).

### Prerequisites

I only tested in Chrome, but I think it should work on any browser that supports ES6.

### Installing

Clone the repo and run:
`npm install`

## Trying stuff around

There is absolutely no documentation except for a few comments that wont make your life easier.
You should know JavaScript and OOP concepts.

While developing, change the `isDev=true` flag in `server.js`

`npm run build_dev`
